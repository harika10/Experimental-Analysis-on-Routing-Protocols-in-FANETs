# Experimental-Analysis-on-Routing-Protocols-in-FANETs

In recent years, there have been progressive
advancement in the field of wireless communication systems.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have rapidly evolved and being
extensively used for military, research and civilian applications.
This report gives a brief description on Flying Ad-Hoc
Networks (FANET). FANET is a subclass of Mobile Ad-Hoc
Networks and made up of a swarm of small flying vehicles
enabled with camera, sensor and GPS system. Different types
of communication architectures have been explained in this
paper. Because of their wireless nature, UAV’s are designed
to travel long distances. This causes topology issues among
UAVs and their base stations which is overcome using topology
construction. Multiple UAV’s can be connected to make a
wider FANET. But this needs dynamic and flexible routing
among UAV’s. Various routing protocols have been introduced
to establish a reliable and robust communication. FANETs are
known for their complex architecture which causes multiple
technological and social implications in the world of Wireless
Communications. The paper includes in-depth research on
Flying Ad-Hoc Networks and challenges faced by network
scientists. We have also conducted experimental analysis on
reactive and proactive routing protocols using NS3 simulation
to achieve insights on their performances using evaluation
metrics like packet delivery ratio, end - end delay and average
throughput.
